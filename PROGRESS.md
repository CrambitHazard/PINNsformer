This can also be viewed in the intent.db. P.S: it is something i am working on.

Day 1 - 30/12/2025 - Coded a single neuron from scratch - single_neuron.py, activation_functions.py
                   - Coded a multi input neuron from scratch - array_neuron.py
                   - Coded a single neural layer from scratch - layer.py
                   - Coded a 2 layer neural network with only forward pass from scratch - network.py
                   - Coded the loss function 'Mean Square Error' into the previous network and added a 3rd layer - loss_functions.py, loss_function_tutorial.py

Day 2 - 31/12/2025 - Recapped Day 1 - recaps/Day1.py
                   - Coded numerical gradient for a single changing parameter - numerical_gradients.py
                   - Refactored latest code from numerical_gradients.py - refactor1.py
                   - Coded how neural networks train themselves, with a few constraints - training_loop.py
                   - Coded how backprop works mostly, doing a backward pass on the last layer only - backprop.py
